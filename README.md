BuildAtlantic Frontend README

Project Name: BuildAtlantic Capstone

Overview:

BuildAtlantic is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application designed to simplify property management tasks. The frontend of this application provides a user-friendly interface for navigating, adding, editing, and deleting property listings while ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience.

Features:

Responsive UI: Built with React, the frontend ensures a clean and interactive user experience.

CRUD Functionality: Users can create, view, update, and delete property listings directly from the interface.

Authentication: Integrated with backend user authentication using JWT to manage secure user sessions.

Dynamic Navigation: Includes multiple pages and views, utilizing React Router for smooth transitions.

Styling: Customized CSS for a professional and visually appealing layout.

Technologies Used:

React (Hooks & Context API)

Axios (API calls)

CSS (styling)

React Router (for routing)

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Node.js

npm or yarn

Installation:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/FullStackCodeJones/Jones_Randi_BuildAtlantic_FrontEnd_Capstone.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Jones_Randi_BuildAtlantic_FrontEnd_Capstone

Install dependencies:

npm install

Running the Application:

Start the development server:

npm start

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Key Challenges:

Connecting the frontend to the backend was particularly challenging, especially ensuring proper communication between API routes and React components. Debugging API calls and managing application state with React Hooks taught me a lot about asynchronous programming and error handling.

Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I gained confidence in implementing React Router for navigation, managing global state, and styling applications effectively. I also learned the importance of debugging techniques when working with asynchronous API calls.
